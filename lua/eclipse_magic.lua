-- **NOTE** At the current time, the "camera.burst()" functionality requires the "lua_fix"
-- beta build of Magic Lantern which can be found at https://builds.magiclantern.fm/experiments.html.
-- Hopefully this function will be merged into the mainline soon.

-- Read through the comments at the top of the script, and modify the contact points to suit
-- your location, and the exposure settings to suit your camera.  Copy the script to
-- the ML/SCRIPTS directory on your camera's media, and run it from the menu.
--
-- If you have issues, (and you aren't running with the test flag set) you should be able to
-- reboot your camera, and it will pick up where it left off.  Exposure events are tied to
-- particular times, not a sequence that needs to start at a specific time.  This is useful if
-- (for example) you need to change batteries in mid-eclipse.
--
-- See http://xjubier.free.fr/en/site_pages/SolarEclipseExposure.html for suggestions for
-- exposure values.

-- 1. Whitespace cleaned-up
-- 2. Added a few functions

-- Variable definitons that have to go here.  Ignore them.
c1 = {}

--
--  If you are testing, set this to 1, and the shutter won't be used.
--  Set it to 0 for the real event.
--
--  This changes how the contact times are interpreted!  If TestBeepNoShutter
--  is set to 1, then the contact times are time elapsed after the script is started.
--  it is set to 0, then the contact times reference the realtime clock of the camera.
--
--  For example:
--
--  If C1 is set to 10:30:00 (ie: 10:30:00 am), and the current time on the camera is set
--  to 08:00:00 (ie: 8:00:00 am), then
--
--  If TestBeepNoShutter is set to 1, then the script will start demonstrating eclipse exposures
--  in ten hours and thirty minutes.
--
--  If TestBeepNoShutter is set to 0, the script will start taking actual exposures in two
--  hours and thirty minutes (ie: at 10:30:00).
--
--  The intent was that (for testing) you could set C1 to 00:00:30 or so, and the other contacts to
--  similar offsets, and not worry about messing with the clock on the camera.  (This may not have
--  been the best choice on my part!  :) )

--
-- Set the 4 contact times here.  Time zone is irrelevant, as long as your camera and these
-- times are the same.  Make sure the times are correct for your location, and that your camera
-- is accurately set to GPS time.

-- Set an aperture value.  The script assumes that the aperture stays constant throughout the
-- eclipe.  The camera will (try to) set this aperture (f-number) at the beginning of the script.

-- If you shoot with LiveView active, you will reduce the amount of mirror slap, giving
-- less vibration.  But.  Some cameras (Such as the 5DmkII.) have a limited range of shutter
-- speed when LV and Movie mode are enabled.  This reduces the available speeds from 30 seconds
-- through 1/8000th of a second to 1/30th to 1/4000th of a second.  Exceeding that range while
-- LV and Movie mode are enabled will crash the script.
--
-- Setting this variable to 1 will, before taking any images, check if LV is running, and if it
-- is, will tell you to turn it off.  If you have disabled movie mode (A menu option on some cameras,
-- like the 5DmkII, and a hardware switch on others) you should set this to 0.
--
-- Test your camera.  If the exposure speeds you want crash the script in LV, check how to disable
-- movie mode.

--
-- If you're shooting in Live View (to reduce mirror slap) you'll probably still want to check
-- your focus occasionally.  However, the status display of the script pretty much fills the screen,
-- making this difficult.  Enabling HideConsole will display the console for the indicated number
-- of seconds both before and after the next shutter event, and turn the console off between.  This
-- also gives you an idea of how much time you have before the next shutter event -- if the console
-- is hidden, you have at least ConsoleShowDelay seconds to mess around.  If you turn this off, the
-- script will start with the console displayed, and you will have to manage it through the Magic
-- Lantern menu.  If you turn it off, it stays off until you turn it on again.

--
-- Even if you shoot with Live View with Silent Mode 1 (which forces the mirror to be
-- locked up, and eliminates the vibration from the shutter opening) there will be slight
-- vibrations introduced as the shutter closes.  According to Jerry Lodriguss at
-- http://www.astropix.com/wp/2017/07/17/mirror-slap-and-shutter-shock/ these vibrations
-- are most prominent between 0.125s and 2s, and can be somewhat mitigated by a slight
-- delay before exposure, to allow the vibration to dampen a bit.

-- exposures, as fast as it can.  You should adjust C23StartOffset so that burst of image straddles

-- CHANGES

-- 1.0.1
    -- Stopped running the seconds_clock event at all times, and moved the tick_offset
        -- calculation to the setup at the start of execution
    -- Fixed the pretty-printing of the timer
    -- Fixed the sign of the C23BurstStartOffset in do_maxc3
    -- Fixed the calculation of the difference between current time and the next second
        -- in wait_until()
    -- Added code to turn off the console during long waits
    -- Massaged the end-of-exposure-bracketing conditions in do_c2max() and do_maxc3()

-- 1.1
    -- Changed the partial phase exposure logic, so that instead of there being an exposure
        -- at C1 and C2, there is an exposure at C1 and an exposure at (C2 - exposure_interval)
        -- so that the totality images are properly centered between the requested partial phase
        -- exposures.
    -- Added an alarm at 30 seconds before C2 and 3 seconds before C3 to alert for any filter changes.
        -- There is also a beep after the C2 and C3 bursts to flag any needed changes.
    -- Split the C23BurstStartOffset into separate variables, to allow an asymmetric burst over
        -- each period.  (ie: 10 seconds before C2 to 3 seconds after C2)

-- 1.2
    -- Added ISO brackets to totality exposure sequence.  Totality now has a preferred ISO,
        -- and will shift to that ISO at the fastest or slowest shutter speeds, then use that
        -- preferred ISO for the requested range of shutter speeds, then shift ISO to the end of
        -- the requested range.
    -- Option to stop LiveView before touching the shutter controls.
    -- Removed the two long exposures at max eclipse -- probably not needed.

-- 1.2.1
    -- Changed call to lv.stop() to a beep, and instruction to the user to turn off LV.
        -- lv.stop() doesn't seem to work.
    -- Added print statements to explain filter warning beeps.

-- 1.3.0
    -- Changed the startup timing loop to be more accurate if the script is started close to
        -- a second boundary.  (The average offset of 999ms and 1ms is 1ms, not 500ms)
    -- Corrected an error in wait_until() -- Used div, where modulus was correct, and had
        -- the tick_offset correction wrong.  Don't code while tired.  Thanks to
        -- matman730 for pointing out this goof.
    -- Improved the configuration comments around TestBeepNoShutter.  They apparently weren't
        -- clear as I thought.

-- 1.4.0  (Not released)
        -- Attempt to implment the changing of the file prefix for the saved images.  It didn'take
            -- work well, and I scrapped it.

-- 1.5.0
    -- Make it optional to hide the console during script running, and allow the delay before
        -- and after the next image to be configured.
    -- Shutter shock reduction:  Add a configurable (in milliseconds) delay before an exposure
        -- where the shutter speed is within a (also configurable) range.
    -- Add a mid-eclipse section.  This is a short section around the max eclipse point to optionally
        -- try for some earthshine exposures.
    -- Set the aperture on program start.
